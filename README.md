# IMAGE-DETECTION
Features:

User-friendly interface with navigation bar, image upload form, and image display section.
Built using React.js for a responsive and smooth user experience.
Back-end powered by Streamlit for image processing tasks.
Utilizes OpenCV and PyTorch for object detection (e.g., vehicle recognition and counting).
Packaged as a Docker application for easy deployment.
Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
Docker Desktop installed on your system.
Setup:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://your_github_repo_url.git
cd your_project_name
Use code with caution.
Install dependencies:

Bash
npm install  # or yarn install
Use code with caution.
Running the Application:

Build the Docker images:

Bash
docker-compose build
Use code with caution.
Run the application:

Bash
docker-compose up
Use code with caution.
This will start the application. The frontend will typically be accessible on http://localhost:80 (adjust the port if mapped differently in docker-compose.yml).

Testing:

Access the application in your web browser.
Use the upload form to select an image from your local machine.
The application will process the image and display both the original and the processed image with detected objects highlighted.
Additional Notes:

You can stop the containers using docker-compose down.
To detach from the running containers and keep them running in the background, use docker-compose up -d.
Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml:

The project includes separate Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend, along with a docker-compose.yml file that specifies the environment and services. These files define how the application is packaged and run within Docker containers.

Further Development:

This project provides a foundation for building a web application with object detection capabilities. You can customize the application by:

Enhancing the user interface using React components and styling libraries.
Expanding the object detection functionalities using OpenCV or other libraries.
Integrating with different back-end frameworks and libraries based on your specific needs.
Support:

For any issues or questions, feel free to consult the project documentation or create an issue on the project's repository (if applicable).
